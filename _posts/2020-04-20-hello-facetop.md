## Introduction

We believe that with crisis comes opportunity. When the recent COVID19 pandemic and shelter-in-place instructions hit our home state of California we decided to step back and brainstorm on ways that we could have a positive impact.

One of the most obvious changes in our lives is the need to wear masks when out in public in groups. This is truly a new behavior for most humans and represents an opportunity to help proper UX and privacy conventions emerge.

## Facetop Computing

In the same way that Desktop computing represented a serious leap forward compaired to mainframe and micro computing&mdash;Facetop computing represents as large of a paradigm shift as desktop and mobile computing.

Wearing smart-masks presents the opportunity to engage with information, data and computation which is uniquely personal. We believe that Facetop computing is a HUGE leap forward and we hope that our work can have a positive impact on the lives of people around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
